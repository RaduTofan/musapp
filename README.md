# musapp
This the Android application for my thesis. The application is based on ML algorithms that generate new songs (MIDI sequences) or continue a song (also a MIDI sequence).
The main library used for the backend was Magenta by Google. I also used Cloud9 (AWS), Flask and Python.
For the Android app I used Android Studio, Java, Async HTTP Client (loopj), MongoDB Stitch.
